# A-Burial-At-Sea
A modern, fantastical adaptation of Lu Xun's Medicine. This project is a website game made out of HTML/CSS and Javascript. The objective was to refresh my web development skills while also producting content under a writing jam. There are features implemented with Javascript and CSS animation. The dev processis inspired by the years of making games in Twine and Liz Daly's <i>Harmonia</i>, an interactive story that was submitted to the 2017 Interactive Fiction Competition. I've always been fascinated with the concept of making an interactive story completely out of scratch. <i>Harmonia</i> was produced within the React/Redux framework. I might try experiment with Angular but I'm still kind of novei with programming at the moment. But here is list of goals for this WIP:

1. To use Javascript further than the DOM. So that means I want to do things like save states, animations, logic and other features that I can't think of at the moment.
2. To make a stylish, readable and responsive site, which was not easy for me to do years ago on Twine due to lack of experience.
3. Actually finish a functional interactive fiction project.
4. Optional: try Angular.
