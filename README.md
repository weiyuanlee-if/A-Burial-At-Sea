# A-Burial-At-Sea
A modern, fantastical adaptation of Lu Xun's Medicine. This project is a website game made out of HTML/CSS and Javascript. The objective was to refresh my web development skills while also producting content under a writing jam. There are features implemented with Javascript and CSS animation. This game uses Twine/Sugarcube 2 but I want to use web development to make it responsive and accessible.
